        Hi, I'm Bhakti Chopra, a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity and secure backend systems. I enjoy understanding how real-world applications fail under attack and how they can be designed to defend against common security vulnerabilities.
        This project reflects my approach to building software with a security-first mindset, focusing not only on functionality but also on resilience, monitoring, and controlled access. Through this system, I explored how authentication is implemented in production environments and how defensive mechanisms such as session management, audit logging, and input validation work together to protect users and data.
